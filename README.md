## Installation

bundle install

## Running

Use the tiny test file test.csv:

        bundle exec ruby liblinear_ruby_classifier.rb

To use another input file, for example stocks.csv:

        bundle exec ruby liblinear_ruby_classifier.rb stocks.csv


Note: if you have an empty (blank) line in the input file then this example will throw an error.

An intermediate file with the suffix ".svm" is written during processing that contains SVM feature vectors.

## Model accuracy

The file test1.csv is tiny: it just includes 16 examples for 2 classifications (or categries). For practical applications the more training data the better. The results with the small test1.csv file will not be good, but when I use this model with many training examples the accuracy is usually > 90%, depending on your data and how many classes you are training.

About 30% of the input data is set aside for testing the trained model.

## API for calling the model

The following **irb** session shows how to cll the trained model:
